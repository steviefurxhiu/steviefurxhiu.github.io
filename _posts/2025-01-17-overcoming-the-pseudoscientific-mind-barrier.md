On this blog I want to delve on a topic which has been personal to me for some time and hope will be of scientific growth for the readers. 
I will discuss how pseudoscientific beliefs have influenced me in the past and how these can be attributed to the human psyche and experience, and how to overcome 
these. 

#### Instinctive and reasoned driven beliefs
  
Have you ever wondered how, subconsciously, you know your choice is right even though you don’t know the exact reason why? Or when facing rapidly occurring phenomena like driving a car and an animal passes in front, your foot automatically hits the brake to avoid a collision? This sets of responses come as innate (sometimes trained) abilities we as humans share with other animals. 
In the book "_Thinking fast and slow_" by Daniel Kahneman, he discusses on this system of thinking and defines it arbitrarily as System 1. Its opposite, which (kind of) differenciates us from animals is also arbitrarily referred as System 2, or namely the reasoned thinking ability. In his book, the author goes on and discusses how these psycological thinking modes can influence our daily thinking and how these can be implemented in economics. For this reson, according to the Nobel committee; “for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty”, he received the Nobel prize in Economics in 2002.  
But how do these two modes of thinking relate to science? Well, you might have heard something like this: “Our intuition is based on classical mechanics and can’t fully grasp or even try to imagine quantum mechanics, which is considered more abstract”. Indeed, our brain fails to imagine abstract phaenomenas. Imagine this, when throwning darts on a wall in the classical world with some ammount of training you perfect how to throw it with perfect aim and strength, but imagine now in the quantum world, instead of darts you have photons with defined energies and the speed it hits the wall is the

talk how you thought that stuff can just fly from one container to the other etc and how to overcome it

or how you always though that biology vs physics and how both are in reality deterministic and etc etc

how to overcome it actually by reading more and being open minded and goes back to science and its definition of what it isis it only a tool or a way of thinking
and the scientific method and what it actually means and how it is iplemented. etc etc
