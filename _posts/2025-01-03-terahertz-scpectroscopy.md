Optical-pump terahertz-probe (THz) spectroscopy is a non-contact method used to determine the photoconductivity of free charges and excitons. One THz corresponds to a frequency of 101210 12  Hz (1 THz ≈ 4 meV) and lies between the microwave and infrared regions in the electromagnetic spectrum. In this study, THz spectroscopy was employed to measure transient changes in the electric field waveforms, with a time duration of a few picoseconds, induced by the excitation of a sample using an optical pump pulse.

The THz conductivity setup utilizes a Mira Oscillator and a Legend HE-USP regenerative amplifier (provided by Coherent Inc.). Measurements were conducted by photoexciting thin films with pump pulses of 60 fs duration and probing photogenerated charge carriers and/or excitons using single-cycle THz pulses, generated in a nonlinear zinc telluride (ZnTe) crystal via optical rectification. The latter produces a THz waveform lasting slightly longer than 1 ps, defining the time resolution of the optical-pump terahertz-probe (OPTP) measurements.

Detection of the THz waveform occurs in the ZnTe crystal by spatially overlapping the THz pulse with a chirped optical laser pulse centered at 800 nm. This allows the entire THz waveform to be recorded by a single laser shot. The transmitted THz waveform is measured before and after photoexcitation—i.e., 
𝐸0(𝑡𝑝)E 0​ (t p​ ) and 𝐸excited(𝑡𝑝,𝑡)E excited (t p ,t), respectively—over a 3.5 ps window, which is determined by the duration of the chirped optical pulse. The time 𝑡𝑝t p  is the detection time of the THz probe waveform, and 𝑡t is the time delay between the THz probe and the laser pump pulse that photoexcites the sample. Pump pulses are generated in the visible and infrared regions using an optical parametric amplifier. The recorded THz waveform undergoes Fourier transformation with respect to 𝑡𝑝t p​ , yielding the complex frequency-dependent change of the THz field as a function of the pump-probe time 𝑡t. Specifically:
          
some formula          

The real part of the quantum yield-weighted mobility stems from the in-phase drift velocity of charge carriers under the probing THz field. Free charges reduce the amplitude of the transmitted THz field. The imaginary part of the mobility arises from the out-of-phase drift velocity of charges and the polarizability of excitons.

In bulk semiconductors and nanomaterials, charge carrier transport is modeled via the complex mobility in the frequency domain. The widely used Drude model describes free charge mobility while accounting for carrier-phonon scattering. For nanomaterials, the Drude-Smith model, an extension of the Drude model, incorporates physical boundaries in nanoscale systems and introduces a back-scattering parameter.

This study provides insights into the mobility of charge carriers in photoexcited semiconductors and nanomaterials using THz spectroscopy. By employing the Drude-Smith model and exploring the effects of THz field interaction, the analysis advances the understanding of charge transport mechanisms on the nanoscale.
