I would like to start my first ever blog with trying to define science and how we to conduct it. One powerful method for defining phaenomena is through how we perceive the surrounding world, namely, through experiencing with our sences. One powerful sense is visualization and it can be conducted physically by seeing something or virtually by imagining something. Personally when I was younger at school I remember being asked: "How do you imagine the word _Science_?", to which I usually recalled the famous painting by the Reinassance master Rafael, [The School of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens).
