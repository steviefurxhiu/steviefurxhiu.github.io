### Atoms, Molecules, HOMO LUMO and transitions

The quantum mechanics' revolution gave way to the new theory of atomic orbitals, which explained how the electron interacts in an atom 
and giving birth to the ideas of the orbitals. Schrödinger's equation treats electrons as propagating waves and it solutions for an atom
gave rise to the quantum numbers (explained in a future blog). The notation of quantum numbers helps us visualize the properties of an electron 
inside the atom. Furthermore, this theory gave rise to Molecular orbital theory (explained in future blog). MO Theory introduced terminology as HOMO
 (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital). HOMO is the orbital highest in energy, where electrons are located
  energetically before energy excitation and LUMO is the lowest lying orbital in the energy scale, which is unoccupied. The lowest possible transition 
  corresponds to an excitation of an electron (aquiring energy) from HOMO to LUMO and its subsequent relaxation to the ground state (HOMO) releases a 
  photon of energy, which has a color (wavelength/energy).

### Waves in Periodic Systems (Crystals)

The previous notation, derived from Schrödinger's equation, is quite useful for atoms and simple molecules but becomes too complex to solve for bigger 
systems _e.g._ crystals which pack many atoms together. For periodic systems, however, we need an easier descriptive model for adapting the Schrödinger's 
equation. First, though, we need to explain what are these periodic systems:

-Insert Image of crystal lattices formulas or unit cell and inverse space etc

Periodic systems are composed of many atoms, which lay rearranged in space with a repetitive orientation. The smallest repetitive unit of a periodic 
system is called an unit cell. Depending on how these atoms are confined inside the unit cell we have different geometric rearrangements referred to as 
crystal lattices. These can be _e.g._ simple cubic, fcc (face centered cubic), bcc (body centered cubic) _etc_. Explain what k vectors are... etc

-Put an image of crystal structures etc bcc fcc and unit cell and unit cell vectors

The position of a wave in such crystals can be easily described by 3D vectors (r). Crystallographers use the notion of inverse space (or reciprocal) for 
describing how waves interact. This notation becomes useful when wave signals (sines and cosies) are translated into signals of frequencies, which are 
more easily measured/interpreted (see Fourier Transform). The description of such waves in the crystal lattice was derived by Felix Bloch in the 1920s 
and his famous Bloch equation is still used nowadays as the solution of the Schrödinger equation for periodic systems.
