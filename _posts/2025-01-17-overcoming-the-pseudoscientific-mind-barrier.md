On this blog I want to delve on a topic which has been personal but hope will be of scientific growth for the readers. 
I will discuss how pseudoscientific beliefs have influenced me in the past and how these can be attributed to the human psyche and experience, and how to overcome 
these. 

#### Instinctive and reasoned driven beliefs
  
Have you ever wondered how when deciding on something, subconsiously you know it is right even though you dont know the exact reason why? Or when facing 
fast occurring phaenomena like driving a car and an aminal passes in front, the foot automatically hits the break to avoid collision. This sets of responses 
come as innate (sometimes trained) abilities we as humans share with other animals. In the book "_Thinking fast and slow_" by Daniel Kahneman he discusses on
this system of thinking and defines it arbitrarily as System 1. Its opposite, which (kind of) differenciates us from animals is System 2, or namely the reasoned thinking ability.
In his book, the author goes on and discusses how these psycological thinking modes can influence our daily thinking and how these can be implemented in economics. 
For this reson and according to the Nobel committee; “for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, 
especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty”, he received the Nobel prize in Economics in 2002.

talk how you thought that stuff can just fly from one container to the other etc and how to overcome it

or how you always though that biology vs physics and how both are in reality deterministic and etc etc

how to overcome it actually by reading more and being open minded and goes back to science and its definition of what it isis it only a tool or a way of thinking
and the scientific method and what it actually means and how it is iplemented. etc etc
