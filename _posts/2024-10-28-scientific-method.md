I would like to start my first ever blog with trying to define science and how to conduct it. One powerful method for defining phaenomena is through how we perceive the surrounding world, namely, through experiencing with our sences. One powerful sense is visualization and it can be conducted physically through sight or virtually through imagination. Personally when I was younger at school I remember being asked: "How do you imagine the word _science_?", to which I usually recalled the famous painting by the Reinassance master Rafael, [The School of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens). This painting, located at the Vatican Musseum, depicts philosophers, mathematicians and scientists from the Ancient world seemingly involved in discussing or indulging in some intellectual activities. I believe this painting clearly represents what the outside world thinks of us scientists. To my toddler mind it usually elicited the idea of a congregation of individuals performing difficult tasks (either physical or intellectual) to achieve some higher or absolute knowledge.
