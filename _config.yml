    description: "Have you ever wondered why the Rosetta Stone played a crucial role for deciphering hieroglyphs? This artifact, with engravings in Ancient Egyptian and Greek, paved the way to understanding a lost ancient culture. I think there is an analogy between this story and the transmission and development of science. Investigating new natural phenomena feels like discovering the Rosetta Stone and deciphering hieroglyphs again. A similar mechanism was at play when Watson and Crick uncovered the structure of DNA and when Einstein established the foundations of relativity.
Active scientific pursuit opens the door to uncovering new Rosetta Stonesâ€”fueling curiosity and the desire to uncover the hidden world. I hope to contribute to this project by posting blogs on various scientific topics, which I hope will serve as little torches for navigating the unknown. Feel free to explore more! :)"
