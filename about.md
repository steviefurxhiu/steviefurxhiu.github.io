Hello world! My name is Stevie and I am doing a PhD in physical chemistry at the University of Sydney. I previously studied undergrad (Chemistry) and Masters (Molecular Nano Science) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.   
I intend to make this blog a repertoire containing scientific ideas and methods. Topics will range from hard sciences to arts and philosophy. Feel free to reach out to me via email for inquiries.

#### List of Quotes (in random order):

"We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ignorabimus. For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be Wir müssen wissen – wir werden wissen ('We must know – we will know')". - David Hilbert   

"en tibi" inquit, "ut sentias quam vile corpus sit iis qui magnam gloriam vident" ("Watch", he is said to have declared, "so that you know how cheap the body is to men who have their eye on great glory") - Livius, Ad urbe condita, 2.12    

"I believe that the world will be saved by beauty. But I mean the beauty that we know, which we are destroying every day. It is difficult to say whether this is the ultimate beauty or not; but we can be sure of one thing: the world is directed by beauty, and we, unfortunately, are losing it every day, and, as if in revenge for it, we fall into a frenzy of loathing." - Fryodor Dostoevsky's novel "The Idiot  

He had a Tolstoy quotation on a wall in his office: "The only legitimate happiness is honest hard work and the surmounting of obstacles". - Astronaut Frank Borman described by NASA Psychologist
