### Scientific opportunities for students and researchers

Below, you can find a list of summer schools and funding opportunities for gaining hands-on research experience in the fields of STEM (mainly physical sciences). Most of them provide full stipends and travel costs for conducting research at their facilities.

- Neutron school (for Masters, PhDs and Postdocs), organized by Forschungzentrum JÃ¼lich
- Erasmus + (for European undergrads and Masters), usually self organized but parter institutions provided by own uni
