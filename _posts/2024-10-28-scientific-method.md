I would like to start my first ever blog with trying to define science and how to conduct it. One powerful method for defining phaenomena is through how we perceive the surrounding world, namely, through experiencing with our sences. One powerful sense is visualization and it can be conducted physically through sight or virtually through imagination. Personally when I was younger at school I remember being asked: "How do you imagine the word _science_?", to which I usually recalled the famous painting by the Reinassance master Raphael, [The School of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens). This painting, located at the Vatican Musseum, depicts philosophers, mathematicians and scientists from the Ancient world seemingly involved in discussing or indulging in some intellectual activities. I believe this painting clearly represents what the outside world thinks of us scientists. To my toddler mind it usually elicited the idea of a congregation of intelligent individuals performing difficult tasks (either physical or intellectual) to achieve some higher or absolute knowledge. This group must be using some methods to figure out the hidden secrets of our world. This method I am alluding to is widely known as the scientific method and forms the basis of modern day discoveries.

Wikipedia defines the scientific method as: ["... an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). By analyzing the meaning of sentence we get two main informations, namely, that the scientific method is an _empirical_ method and that it fully developed to its modern day form around the _17th century_. Empirical means "through experience" and corresponds to _e.g._ my intial example of sensing through visualization. The starting date of the scientific method is a bit debated and the article is clearly refering to the start of the scientific revolution in Europe. This does not mean that previous generations did not indulge in scientific discoveries. Ancient Greece is widely credited for inventing science with Aristotle often being considered the father of the proto-scientific method. He laid down the basis for the rational examination of natural phaenomena. He is also credited with distinguishing between _induction_, the interference of universal principles from particular observation and _deduction_, in which general principles are used to make predictions in specific situations. Though, most of Aristotle's deductive work turned out to be incorrect, his mode of thinking laid the basis for an important example to follow. Another important ancient greek tradition still present nowadays is rhetoric, in which oratory is used for persuading through means of reason. Unfortunately though, much of the classical knowledge gradually became lost in the western world during the middle-ages, but it managed to survive elsewhere. The "Islamic Golden Age" is often considered as one of the catalytic agents which fueled the coming European scientific discoveries after the middle-ages. Scholars like Averroes (Ibn Rushd), which is accredited for trasmitting Aristotleian ideas to the west, and many more continued developing the different fields of science. Indeed a considered equivalet to the School of Athens was the House of Wisdom in Bagdad, which functioned as a public library and intellectual centre. This points out that another important criterias for scientific discovery are communication and transmittance of ideas. For this reason, scientific journals exist today and they are often s.   
Thus the scientific method can be expressed as: a means of inducing and/or deducing an explanation through empirical evidence, where the communication and transmittance of ideas and knowledge is essential for fact-checking and further advancements on the so-laid works. Another simpler way of wording it is: to derive a theory from experimental evidence and open-source it to the world for proving or disproving your claim. The Italian theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli further says: "Science is not about certainty. Science is about finding the most reliable way of thinking at the present level of knowledge. ... In fact, it's the lack of certainty that grounds it". While this method of concluding some things with reasonable certainty, it is important to note the importance of humility to remain open to new evidence and ideas.
