Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique which measures the difference of absorption between left (LCP) and right circularly polarized light (RCP). Based from this short definition, CD is no different, other than the sensibility of its detector (LCP vs RCP), than UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. 
Light is usually described as being both a particle (composed of photons) and a wave (electro-magnetic continuum). For explaining CD, we need to employ the wave-like description of light and how this interacts with the medium. 

Insert image with different ligth polarizations

Imagine a beam of light, which is linearly polarized (wave continuum propagation is always parallel to one axis) and the electric and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other. Now imagine that instead of being linear, the wave has a circular polarization (CPL). Light can only be polarized in two different orientations which usually are described following the propagation of light, as right (clockwise) and left (counterclockwise) polarized.

Initially, you may ask why would there be a need to study the interaction of matter with this kind of light, but due to the opposite polarizations of light, thus photon angluar momenta, it interacts differently or preferentially with chiral materials. But what is chirality?

Insert picture with chirality

Chirality comes from the Ancient Greek word for hand and is usually described with the left and right hand pictures. Left and right hands are chiral because they do not superimpose (lay on top of each other) with its mirrored image on each other due to their different orientation. Whereas, an achiral object, can superimpose on top of its mirrored image. From this initial description we deduce that chiral object lack mirror symmetry but also inversion symmetry. Inversion symmetry refers to e.g. swapping all the opposite vertices with each-other and still having the same system. For example, lets imagine the two molecules Coronene and Helixacene. Coronene has both in-plane and out-of-plane symmetry, thus mirror and inversion symmetry operation also. Helixacene instead due to its shape has lack of in-plane and out-of-plane symmetry due to its shape thus it is chiral. In fact there exist two kinds of Helixacene, one having a clockwise (R) axis of rotation and one anticlockwise (S). Both molecules are indenticall in all physicochemical properties which do not involve chirality (boiling point, viscosity etc) except how the interact with other chiral media. Chiral molecules interact differently with different polarized light beams and can be distinguished through CD. In fact, separating chiral molecules is a very important industrial process in fields like pharaceuticals (see Thalidomide incident). 

Image with CD lambert beer law formulas ellipticity etc

As CD is a measurement of absorption, it follows the Lambert-Beer law and hence its signal scales with concentration. It is also expressed as a response of ellipticity (Î¸). CD is oftern expressed as a function of dissimetry factor (g Abs) for normalizing its response to the Lambert-Beer relationship. In fact g Abs is a materials' property and its often used to compare different materials' degree of absorbing CPL. An increasing g Abs response in molecules with increasing concentration can indicate formation of supermolecular aggregates.  

Follow ppt but also explain why LCP interacts with one spin and why RCP etc and also
