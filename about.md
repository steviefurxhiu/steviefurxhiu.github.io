Hello world! My name is Stevie and I am doing a PhD in physical chemistry at the University of Sydney. I previously studied undergrad (Chemistry) and Masters (Molecular Nano Science) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. I intend to make this blog a repertoire where scientific ideas and methods are found. Topics will range from hard sciences to arts and philosophy. Feel free to reach out to me via email for inquiries.
