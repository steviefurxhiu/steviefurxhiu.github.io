Hello world! My name is Stevie and I am a physical chemistry PhD student at the University of Sydney. I previously studied undergrad (Chemistry) and Masters (Molecular Nano Science) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. I will try to post scientific content or anecdotes once a week. Topics will range from hard sciences to arts and philosophy. Feel free to reach out to me via email for inquiries.
